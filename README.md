# __Smart Intercom / Doorbell__
## Project by: Renee Bishara, Jana Simaan & Maria Simaan.
In this project we built a smart doorbell that allows visitors to communicate with the homeowner via audio and gain entry using a one-time code. 
The main features of this project are :  
Real-Time Audio Communication - Visitors can send audio message to the admin directly through the doorbell.  
One-Time Code Access - Admin can generate a one-time entry code for visitors.
Combines real-time audio communication and internet-based access control, providing a secure and efficient solution for remote visitor management.
